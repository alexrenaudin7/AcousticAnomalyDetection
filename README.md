# AcousticAnomalyDetection

This project offers a **machine learning** (ML) solution for **acoustic anomaly aetection** (AAD) in electric motors.
A support vector machine (SVM) model was built to identify faulty or dangerous behaviour of a drop saw.

The model is trained on a original dataset of saw cut audio recordings.
A custom feature extraction program was built to develop the ML dataset.

Project work was done as part of my Masters thesis, submitted October 2023.  

Repository includes:
 - **feature_extraction.py:** Feature extraction program
 - **SVM.py:** SVM machine learning model program
 - **dataset.csv:** An instance of the feature extraction program output dataset
 - **/audio:** Original audio recordings (pre-processed to 1s each)
 - **/reporting:**  Poster providing a project overview + a copy of the full thesis
