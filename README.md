# AcousticAnomalyDetection

This project offers a Machine Learning (ML) solution for Acoustic Anomaly Detection (AAD) in electric motors.
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was built to identify faulty or dangerous behaviour of a drop saw.

The model is trained on a original dataset of saw cut audio recordings.
A custom feature extraction program was built to develop the ML dataset.

Project work was done as part of my Masters thesis, submitted October 2023.  

Repository includes:
 - Original audio recordings (trimmed to 1s each)
 - Feature extraction program 
 - SVM machine learning model program
 - Poster providing an overview of project work
 - A copy of my full thesis
